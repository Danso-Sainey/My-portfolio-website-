      <h2>Welcome To My Website!</h2>

      <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
      <p>
        I am Sainey Danso, a passionate researcher in <strong>Machine Learning for IoT Networks</strong> and a Master’s student in Embedded Systems and Robotics. My work bridges the gap between 
        artificial intelligence, wireless communication, and embedded technologies, aiming to 
        design smarter, more efficient, and resilient IoT systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        My passion lies in developing intelligent, data-driven solutions that enhance 
        the reliability, adaptability, and security of connected devices. I am particularly 
        fascinated by the intersection of <strong>Edge AI</strong>, <strong>Lightweight Deep Learning</strong>, 
        and <strong>Resource-Constrained IoT Environments</strong>. I believe that the future of intelligent 
        systems depends on our ability to bring computation closer to the edge, where data is generated.
      </p>

      <h3>My Research Focus</h3>
      <p>
        My current research explores the integration of <strong>AI and Machine Learning models 
        into IoT networks</strong> to enable smarter decision-making and adaptive communication. 
        I am particularly focused on building efficient models for <strong>signal classification</strong>, 
        <strong> jamming detection</strong>, and <strong>jamming cancelation </strong>. 
        My goal is to contribute to the development of privacy-preserving and energy-efficient 
        networks that can operate autonomously in dynamic environments.
      </p>

      <h3>Beyond Research</h3>
      <p>
        Beyond technical innovation, I am deeply committed to promoting <strong>AI and IoT literacy</strong>. 
        I believe that empowering individuals with a foundational understanding of emerging technologies 
        is essential for inclusive and sustainable progress. Whether through mentorship, collaborative 
        research, or community outreach, I aim to inspire others to explore, learn, and create.
      </p>
